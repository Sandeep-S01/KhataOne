# KhataOne Project Tracker

## Project Status

Status: Implementation started. Phase 0 and Phase 1 are complete; Phase 2 through Phase 13 foundations are in progress.

## Current Focus

- Verify AI extraction fallback layer so simple WhatsApp text invoices can become Review Queue items without paid OpenAI credits.
- Verify automatic AI extraction job processing on live Supabase/Vercel after applying the new worker migration and adding `CRON_SECRET`.
- Verify Phase 2 against a live Supabase project.
- Apply Supabase migrations for lead requests, firms, and memberships.
- Verify Phase 4 client management against a live Supabase project.
- Continue Phase 3 dashboard shell with filters, modals, and real data wiring.
- Verify Phase 5 WhatsApp webhook with Meta after environment variables and public URL are configured.
- Verify Phase 6 AI extraction against real OpenAI and Supabase credentials.
- Verify Phase 7 review actions and ledger handoff against live Supabase data.
- Verify Phase 8 ledger filters and correction workflow against live Supabase data.
- Verify Phase 9 GST summary generation against live approved transactions.
- Verify Phase 10 reports and exports against live Supabase Storage and real approved transaction/GST summary data.
- Verify Phase 11 audit, operations, rate-limit, and production smoke checklist against live deployment settings.
- Verify Phase 12 health checks, smoke scripts, demo seed, deployment runbook, and RLS verification plan against a live Supabase project and deployed app.
- Keep Phase 13 platform extensions behind explicit provider, compliance, RLS, audit, and smoke-test gates.
- Local environment values from the old application credential file have been mapped into `.env.local`; OpenAI credentials remain missing unless supplied separately.

## Open Decisions

- Final launch CTA: demo booking, waitlist, direct signup, or all three.
- GST integration provider strategy.
- Billing model and pricing.
- Whether production v1 needs staff invite flow or owner-only workspace first.
- Whether Tally export is required in production v1 or v1.1.
- Whether PDF processing uses built-in extraction only or a dedicated OCR pipeline.

## Risks

- AI extraction accuracy must be validated with Indian invoices and receipts.
- GST workflows must remain CA-reviewed.
- WhatsApp sender matching must handle shared phones and business owners with multiple GSTINs.
- RLS and firm isolation must be tested early.
- Export formats must be checked by practicing CAs.

## Next Tasks

- Apply `supabase/migrations/20260812090000_normalize_transactions_nullable_fields.sql` in Supabase if Operations "Run now" reports any not-null violation on draft transaction fields such as `date`, `amount`, or `category`.
- Deploy AI extraction fallback layer and set `AI_EXTRACTION_PROVIDER_ORDER=rule_based_text` in Vercel for no-credit testing.
- Apply `supabase/migrations/20260811110000_add_ai_extraction_job_worker.sql` in Supabase.
- Add `CRON_SECRET` to Vercel environment variables and redeploy so Vercel Cron can call `/api/jobs/ai-extraction/run-queued`. Hobby deployments use daily cron; use the Operations "Run now" action or an external scheduler for immediate testing.
- Send a matched WhatsApp text invoice and confirm it automatically appears in Review Queue without manually calling `/api/jobs/ai-extraction`.
- Configure Supabase environment variables locally.
- Apply Supabase migrations.
- Verify signup, login, firm onboarding, protected dashboard, and signout against Supabase.
- Verify client create, edit, archive, RLS isolation, and audit logs against Supabase.
- Add shared dashboard filter/modal primitives.
- Configure WhatsApp environment variables and public webhook URL.
- Verify Meta webhook challenge and signed POST delivery.
- Verify media download/upload to private Supabase storage.
- Verify matched and unmatched sender behavior.
- Configure `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_EXTRACTION_MODEL`, and optional `JOB_RUNNER_SECRET`.
- Verify AI extraction with text-note documents.
- Add OCR/PDF/audio text extraction before relying on media-only documents.
- Verify Phase 7 approve, edit, reject, duplicate, clarification, audit, and ledger handoff flows against Supabase.
- Verify Phase 8 ledger filters, entry detail, correction flow, and correction audit logs against Supabase.
- Verify Phase 9 GST period generation, readiness status, tax buckets, source transactions, and audit logs against Supabase.
- Verify Phase 10 CSV/PDF generation, private storage upload/download, and export audit logs against Supabase.
- Verify Phase 11 audit log filtering, operations job visibility, endpoint rate limiting, and settings readiness with live credentials.
- Connect structured operational logs to Sentry or chosen monitoring provider.
- Run `npm run verify` and `SMOKE_BASE_URL=<deployment-url> npm run smoke:local` in deployment pipeline.
- Run `npm run seed:demo` after live Supabase migrations and at least one Auth user exist.
- Complete `docs/RLS-Verification-Plan.md` with two live test firms.
- Review `docs/Platform-Extensions-Roadmap.md` before implementing GST filing, GSTR comparison, bank reconciliation, reminders, sync, billing, analytics, or admin console features.
- Replace the planned GST provider boundary only after verifying an approved provider contract/docs and adding production smoke checks.
- Validate export formats with a practicing CA before marking production-ready.
- Add first end-to-end demo path with seeded data.
